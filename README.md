[Stacky] Simple icon stacks solution for Windows
============================================================================================

> **Upstream note:** the original project by Pawel Turlejski (`https://github.com/pawelt/stacky`) is no longer maintained.
> This fork modernizes and extends Stacky while keeping the same “instant menu” philosophy.

## What is it

Stacky is a small program for Windows that displays contents of a given directory as a list of clickable, labeled icons.

It's designed to be pinned to the taskbar as a single shortcut that opens a fast popup menu of your shortcuts.

## What’s new in this fork
> Most changes were made with **AI assistance**

This fork keeps Stacky’s original caching approach and adds several quality-of-life and performance improvements:
### Performance & UX
- **Separators**
- **Hides extension for certain file types**: bat, cmd, exe, lnk, url, vbs
- **Shift+Click navigates to target**
- **Multi-monitor support**
- **Submenu support**
- **Lazy submenu population**: submenus are built only when opened, which keeps the initial menu display snappy even for large stacks.
- **Owner-draw menu rendering**:
  - **DPI-aware icon scaling** (crisp icons on high-DPI displays)
  - **Smart middle ellipsis for long paths** (base folder entry uses path ellipsis)
- **Dark-mode aware rendering** (menu background/text/highlight colors - **not fully supported though - menu shadow is still light**)

### Organization features
- **Submenus via folders ending in `.submenu`**
  - `Tools.submenu\` becomes a submenu named `Tools`
  - nested `.submenu` folders create nested submenus
- **Separators via “marker files”**
  - files ending in `.separator` or `.separator.lnk` are rendered as menu separators

### Folder entry improvements
- Top menu entry for the base folder:
  - Respects `--hide-header`
  - Uses the folder icon and also supports **custom folder icons from `desktop.ini`**
  - Displays the only the folder name with `--compact-header` option or displays full path (and path-ellipsized when needed) without the option


Installation
------------

There is no installation. Just download precompiled package from `binaries` directory (`stacky-x64.zip`, also contains CRT dependencies) and unzip.

Direct link to precompiled binaries: https://github.com/clau-bucur/stacky/blob/master/binaries/stacky-x64.zip?raw=true


Compilation
-----------

You can build Stacky with free Microsoft tools, using solution file in the `vsproj` directory.

Full source code is available in `src` directory.

Notes for this fork:
- Tested with **Visual Studio 2026** and platform toolset **v145**.
- The project uses standard Win32 APIs and links to common system libraries (e.g., `Comctl32`, plus any additional libs you added for rendering).



How to use it
-------------

1. Create a regular windows shortcut to `stacky.exe`.
2. Create a folder and put shortcuts to your programs there.
3. Edit the shortcut and add the folder's path to the `Target` field, so it looks something like this:

      `D:\pawel\Programs\Stacky\stacky.exe D:\pawel\Stacks\Games`
      
4. Drag the stack shortcut to your taskbar.

### Options

Append options after the folder's path:
- `--hide-header` Hides the top menu entry (the base folder item) and its separator.
- `--compact-header` Shows only the folder name for the top menu entry, instead of the full path.
- `--dark-mode` Shows the menu in dark mode. Not fully supported though. The shadow still remains in light-mode.

      `D:\pawel\Programs\Stacky\stacky.exe D:\pawel\Stacks\Games --compact-header --dark-mode`

That's all. You can click the Stacky shortcut on the taskbar to open the new stack.


Why is it useful
----------------

You can replace a bunch of icons on your taskbar with one icon. 

Say you use Photoshop, Illustrator, Axure and couple other design-related programs. Instead of putting individual shortucts in your taskbar, you can create a folder called "Design", put all your design shortcuts there and create one shortcut on a taskbar.

Whenever you click on the icon, you will see all the icons you put in the folder, ready to launch.

If you have 30+ programs, it is really convenient to split them into couple groups, instead of squizing in all icons right in the taskbar.

Stacks with shortcuts to folders to your projects, movies, pictures and anything else work great too.


Why would you use Stacky instead of...
--------------------------------------

There are couple products on the market that do similar thing, like [RocketDock](http://rocketdock.com/) or [7stacks](http://alastria.com/software/7stacks/). In fact, I used 7stacks for quite some time. These are fine products, but stacky has some unique features that you may like:

- it is open source and 100% free
- it does one thing and does it well
- it's very small, requires no installation, no external configuration etc.
- but most of all, it's the fastest available solution


Why is it so fast?
------------------

Because Stacky caches stacked icons. Instead of reading and analyzing `.lnk` files (Windows shortcuts), and then fetching icons from corresponding executables every time you open a stack, Stacky stores all icons in one small file in the stack folder. When user opens a stack, no `.lnk` file nor `.exe` files are touched. Only Stacky cache file.

Any time the shortcuts folder is modified (new shrtcut is added etc.), the cache is rebuilt.

7stacks every now and then makes you wait good couple seconds, before it renders the stack. Stacky never, ever does it. Stacks are displayed immediately, every time.

That's why stacky is faster than anything I've seen so far.
